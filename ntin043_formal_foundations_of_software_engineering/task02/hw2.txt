topic: models in Alloy

task 1: create model for "smart home" or "automated smart warehouse"
  !! pick just one option !!

  option A: smart home
      - important aspects: various sensors, control, security and other equipment
      - you have to decide what entities and operations to capture in the model
          - example: temperature (heating), smoke, lights, cameras, movement, automated locking
          - example: automatically turn on/off some devices based on values recorded by sensors
      - do not forget to define some assertions (facts) and commands (run, check)

task 2: document your solution
	- explain key design decisions and more advanced usage of VDM/Alloy

	Smart home has one control unit that manages several devices (controllers that collect measures from sensors). House has several rooms and in every room there is at least one sensor.
	House has at least one door (inside/outside) with smart intercom. There are several simulations of states and transitions between them for sensors/controllers and intercom/door.

	Key design decisions:
	- Abstract class Sensor implement two classes NumericSensor and BoolSensor that collect data in different ways.
	- Class Room has set of Sensors, that is not empty.
	- Control Unit has set of devices (controllers) that is not empty.
	- Sensors send measurements to controllers that re part of Control Unit.
	- Controllers make some action based on measurements.
	- class SmartHome has set of rooms, that is not empty, at least one door and one ControlUnit.

	As for more advanced usage for Alloy, concept of time was used during modeling. With help of differnet points in time it was possible to create different states and show transitions between
	them.

task 3: evaluate your solution (model) according to the following criteria
	- level of abstraction (in the sense "what details you ignored")

	Details about how sensors, controllers and control units work in real life were ignored. If I compare this model with previous in Maude, I would say that here I described less in more details.
	Here by details I mean different states in whic devices can be. And originally I thought about making class Room abstract and there would be several classes like Kitche, LivingRoom etc. But 
	then I thought it would be over-specification and decided to make only one class Room.

	- level of approximation (over-, under-) in the sense "over-specification/over-constraining (specification is too restrictive) versus under-specification/under-constraining (model is too permissive)"

	In that model I think it is somewhere in the middle, even though there could be more types of sensors. I dont think the model is over-specified and what I like is that it can be extended with help
	of abtsract classes and sets.

	- ambiguity versus precision

	I would not say the system is precise, again it is connected deteails that were ignored. But a good thing is that every device is in some state at any point of time. And  every state is descibed with 
	details.

	- completeness (all scenarios)
	For the current model I think I describe all possible states of sensors.

task 4: tell me your opinion about the modeling language, tool, and the whole approach (methodology) based on your personal experience
	- specifically, can you imagine to use something like that (whole approach) in practice given proper tool support in some IDE

	I liked ALloy more than maude, because it was easier to understand syntax. I liked how with help of time concept I was able to simulate states and transitions. As for IDE, I think Extension
	in VS code is pretty good as it shows warnings/errors and I can run/debug models in VS code. It is defenetely more comfortable to work with than maude.

	- possible usage scenarios to consider: validating the design of a complex system, capturing and validating requirements (maybe for consistency), precise documentation

	I liked how I could generate an instance of model and go back and forth between states, but in case of big model I think the visualization of models would be confusing. I started to get confused with 
	my model, so i needed to implement all parts separetely, make sure they behave the way I thought the should, and only after put it all together. And still I think I can understand the mode,
	because I implemented it in parts that I know how work, but for someone who sees only finished model understnding of how it works can be hard. So I would not use that tool to describe big and too 
	complex models. But for describing behaivior of smaller parts or validating requirements of the system with checks the tool is perfect. Another problem is debugging after requirement is not met by
	the model...

note: you can define the model in VDM or Alloy (pick one language)
