Tasks
-----

This assignment has five alternatives - Ant, Maven, MSBuild+NuGet, Gradle, and CMake.
You should pick just 1-2 based on your favorite platform and programming language.
Alternatively, it is also possible to create the build script (using either Ant, Maven, MSBuild, Gradle, or CMake) for your own program with similar complexity like those provided by me.
Send all the build scripts and configuration files along with a complete report.

Note that you can work on this assignment for 1-2 build tools.
If you submit two different build scripts, then it will be counted as two completed assignments.

The "ftp" directory contains two subdirectories: "src" with the sources of a very simple
FTP server and "lib" with few JAR files representing external dependencies (libraries).
The main class is "org.apache.ftpserver.commandline.CommandLine".


Ant: Write the Ant build script for the FTP server - the file "ftp/build.xml".
   - Respect the common directory layout:
         src -> source files (.java)
         build -> class files
         lib -> third-party dependencies, libraries
   - The build script must define the following targets: clean, build, dist, run.
   - Specify classpaths using "filesets". All jar files in the "lib" directory
       must be included. However, do not enumerate individual jar files.
       (Hint: use wildcards properly)
   - Use properties for directory names (paths).
   - Specify reasonable dependencies between targets.
   - The JAR file generated by the target "dist" must contain:
       - all class files generated by the Java compiler
       - manifest file with the attributes "Project" (use the value "FTP")
           and "BuildDate" (use the current date)
   - Name of the JAR files must reflect the current date (e.g., "ftpserver-YYYYMMDD.jar").
   - The "clean" target must remove the directory with class files and the JAR file.
   - The "run" target should execute the compiled program such that its output is 
       redirected into a file specified inside the build script.
   - The "run" target should, before attempting to execute the program, check presence of the JAR file and whether the JAR file is up-to-date.
       If the JAR file does not exist, or when it is obsolete, then print some message and fail graciously.
   - The "dist" target should also create a zip file that contains all the source files (and only them).
   - The default target should be "build".
   - Test the Ant build script by executing "ant clean" followed by "ant dist".
       Paste the output of Ant here.

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 2 seconds

Maven: Write the Maven build script for the FTP server - the file "ftp/pom.xml".
   - The script has to support the following actions: building, creating of a JAR file, run/execute, clean.
   - Make sure that everything works as expected.
   - Follow the standard concepts and best practices associated with Maven.
   - Test the Maven build script and paste the output of Maven here.


MSBuild+NuGet: Write scripts for building your C# program of a reasonable size and creating its package.
   - Also use the .NET Core Templates where and how it makes sense.


Gradle: Write the build.gradle script for Gradle that closely mimics functionality required of the scripts created for Ant (build.xml) or Maven (pom.xml).
   - Make sure that everything works properly (as expected).
   - Follow the standard concepts and best practices associated with Gradle.


CMake: Write the necessary configuration files and scripts for CMake that can be used instead of Makefiles created within a previous homework (Make) for building the "mydb" program.
   - Ensure that everything works properly.
   - Follow the standard concepts and best practices associated with CMake.

Survey:
-------

We use the survey to evaluate the labs (tasks) and homework assignments.
It is completely voluntary, but useful for future tuning of the content and level of complexity of the labs.
Most questions can be answered using the scale from 1 to 10.
Write your answer under the corresponding question.

(1) How new was the topic and content of the lab for you?
     (1 - brand new, 10 - I already knew everything)
     4


(2) Do you think that the content of this lab was useful?
     (1 - useless or too trivial, 10 - very useful)
     10


(3) How do you evaluate the level of complexity of the homework assignment?
     (1 - too trivial, 5-6 - just about right, 10 - too demanding or complex)
    5

(4) How do you evaluate your prior experience with the tool in the context of the homework assignment?
     (1 - I already know and can use everything, 10 - I tried everything practically for the first time)
    8

(5) How much time (in minutes) did you spend working on the homework assignment? 90


(6) Additional space for your own comments on the lab and homework assignment:
