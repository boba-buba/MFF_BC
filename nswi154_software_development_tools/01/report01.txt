------------------------------------
1. Configure your identity (name, email) on the target machine, if you have not already.

Already done, but if not it would be:
git config --global user.name "Nataliia Korop"
git config --global user.email "n.corop08@gmail.com"

2. Create your own private Git repository in a local project directory (working copy).
In newly created directory on my local machine I run:
git init
git config --global init.defaultBranch master

3. Next create a new file that contains a simple program computing factorials for numbers 1 to 10. You are free to use any other program with similar difficulty and length, in case you do not like to compute factorials, but then please adapt other tasks of the assignment (see below). The program should print each computed factorial on a separate line. Use your favorite programming language (C, Java, C#, Python, ...). Make the file tracked by Git. Save current version into the repository.
nano factorial.c //code writing
git add factorial.c
git commit -m "factorial counter"

4. Split the program into two parts: (1) a library that contains the function for computing factorials and (2) a client that invokes the procedure. Use an approach typical for your favorite programming language. However, you have to create new file(s) to contain the new parts.
nano main.c // code writing

5. Ensure that new file(s), created in step 4, are tracked by Git and commit everything into the repository.
git add main.c
git commit -m "add main.c"

6. Remove the original file created in step 3 (make sure it is not tracked by Git anymore). Commit everything.
rm factorial.c
git rm factorial.c
git commit -m "delete factorial.c"

7. Create new branch with the name "oneline" and switch to it.
git branch oneline
git checkout oneline

8. In your branch, modify the program to print all computed factorials on a single line. Commit everything properly.

nano factorial.c // tady nechapu,jestli jsme smazali soubor v minulem kroku, zde jej nemodifikujeme ale vytvarime novy??
git add factorial.c
git commit -m "output on one line"9. Go back to the original branch (master).
git checkout master

10. Make the following two changes to the factorial program in the given order, but commit only the second modification. (i) Program should compute factorials for the numbers 1 to 15. (ii) Add new procedure that computes and prints squares of numbers 1 to 10. 
nano main.c // i)
nano square.c // ii)
git add square.c
git commit -m "add square procedure to lib"

11. Print the current status of the working copy and all uncommitted modifications.
git st

On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   main.c

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

12. Revert uncommitted modifications in the working copy.
git restore main.c

13. Merge the branch "oneline" into the last version on the master branch.
git merge oneline

14. Print short information about each commit.

git log --pretty=short

15. Somehow move the local repository and working directory back to the state they were after task 9 (undo all changes done later).
git reset --hard 5f945677c64a9a5ecec2731b4a5cdad21125cb07

16. Clone existing repository into a completely separate directory (new working copy).	URL: https://gitlab.mff.cuni.cz/teaching/nswi154/cviceni2024.git	Note that your Git client may use GUI to ask for the password, so it may not work when you do it in console remotely over ssh.	You probably have to log in at least once through the web interface (https://gitlab.mff.cuni.cz) to ensure that your Git account is created.	Let me know if you have any problems with accessing the repository (it works for me, but I cannot use it from a student account, obviously).
git clone git@gitlab.mff.cuni.cz:teaching/nswi154/cviceni2024.git

17. Modify content of the file main.c somehow. For example, add the code printing your name.
nano main.c // adding name

18. Print all modifications done in the working copy.

git diff

diff --git a/main.c b/main.c
index 6bd7f37..bd8b16f 100644
--- a/main.c
+++ b/main.c
@@ -45,6 +45,7 @@ int main(int argc, char **argv) {
   printf("Jakub Mudra\n");
   printf("Petr Hrdina\n");
   printf("Tamar Noselidze\n");
+  printf("Nataliia Korop\n");
   ((void (*)(void *))func)(puts);
   return 0;
 }

19. Update your working copy to match the current state of the remote public repository (at the server "gitlab.mff.cuni.cz"). Someone might have changed the remote repository in the meantime.
git pull

20. Publish your modifications in the remote repository (at the server "gitlab.mff.cuni.cz").
git add main.c 
git commit -m "added my name"
git push

21. Create new branch in your local repository (cloned from the server "gitlab.mff.cuni.cz") that starts in the version that was HEAD at the point of time when you cloned the original remote repository (gitlab.mff). Give unique name to your branch (to avoid conflicts with other students). Make some changes in the branch (e.g., add new files with some content) and commit them.
git log --pretty=short // to find right commit hash
git branch biba_boba_buba_beba 5d6abca023dcba5da4eae291d255eaddadd548c3
git checkout biba_boba_buba_beba
nano better_main.c // code writing
git add better_main.c
git commit -m "add better main.c"

22. Merge the current HEAD of the master branch into your branch created in the previous task (everything just in the local repository).
git merge master

23. Publish your branch to the remote repository.
git push --set-upstream origin biba_boba_buba_beba

24. Remove the whole directory "cviceni2024" that contains your local repository. Clone the existing repository again (like in the task 16).
rm -r cviceni2024
git clone ...

25. List all the branches. Switch to your own branch that you created in the task 21.
git br -a

26. Alternative solution for task 13 that will use rebasing. If you have not used "rebase" in task 13, then do it here.
git rebase origin/biba_boba_buba_beba 

27. Alternative solution for task 10 that does not use "git add -p" or "git add -i". Hint: use stashing if you have not done so already.

Tady taky nechapu, kde to mam pouzit? Ve stare slozce ze zadani 2 nebo ve slozce cviceni2024Predpokladam, ze ve slozce ze zadani 2.

nano main.c // some coding
git stash
nano square.c // some coding
git add square.c
git commit -m "add square procedure" 

28. Extension of task 21: modify the last commit message (add some text).

git rebase -i HEAD~10 // otevre se soubor s poslednimi 10 commity
reword commit ... // tim oznacime, ze commit pouzijeme ale chceme zmenit text commitu
// po zavreni tohoto souboru vyskoci okno se souborem, kde muzeme zmenit commit zpravu29. Clone existing repository at the URL https://github.com/d3sformal/panda.git. Find the numbers (IDs) of all revisions created by me (try author names "Pavel Parizek" and/or "pparizek") since 1.7.2014.
git log --author="Pavel Parizek" --since="2014-07-01"

30. Now consider the repository at https://github.com/d3sformal/yaga.git. Create the diff of all changes in the branch "feature/uf-plugin" since the date 1.6.2023.

git log --before="2023-06-01" --pretty=format:%H -1 // tim ziskame nepozdejsi commit ktery byl drive, nez to datum
git diff 610ed594e318b1e554099431562ef3139369a4e0 // ten commit z predchoziho prikazu, to ukaze vsechny zmeny od toho commit do posledniho commitu
