# Milestone 04: Preemptive Scheduler and Synchronization

The goal of this milestone is to extend your kernel with support for
preemptive thread scheduling and with basic synchronization primitives
as optional extensions. Once implemented, threads will not need to
explicitly *yield* the processor to other threads to achieve multitasking
--- the kernel will switch between threads periodically in response to
interrupts from a timer device.

This may appear to be a relatively simple change, but it has far-reaching
consequences. In general, whenever a thread works with shared data, it must
ensure that its actions do not conflict with the actions of other threads.

Achieving this is easier when threads are scheduled cooperatively, because
the running thread determines when other threads can run --- it can
simply avoid yielding the processor to other threads while in the middle
of a sensitive non-atomic operation (critical section), e.g., connecting
pointers when adding or removing item to a linked list.

It is important to realize that with preemptive scheduling the currently
running thread is **no longer in control** ---  it can be **interrupted
and rescheduled at any time**, i.e., even in the middle of a critical
section (resulting in data corruption or some other errorneous behavior).
In this context, threads need some means to access shared data in an
orderly fashion, hence the need for synchronization primitives.

Even though the milestone is split into two parts (to reflect the
logical distinction between scheduling and synchronization), preemptive
scheduling and synchronization really go hand-in-hand.

---

## Part 1: Preemptive Scheduler

To perform preemptive scheduling, your kernel needs to switch between threads
without waiting for the currently running thread to yield the processor. But
for this to happen, the processor needs to be executing the kernel code which
implements the context switching, i.e., it needs to somehow interrupt whatever
the current thread is doing.

This is typically achieved with the help of a timer device, which will
periodically issue an interrupt request to the processor. When interrupt
processing is enabled on the CPU, a timer interrupt causes the CPU to jump
into an interrupt handler code of the kernel, i.e., it will stop executing the
code of the currently running thread. In the timer interrupt handler code, the
kernel can invoke the scheduler to forcibly switch context to another thread.

The MIPS processor provides a cycle-based counter that can be used as a simple
timer device.
Your scheduler code will need to configure the timer device using the
`timer_interrupt_after()` function defined in the
[`drivers/timer.h`](kernel/include/drivers/timer.h) header file, which
allows setting the interval until next timer interrupt (see the section
on [timer control](#timer-control) for more details).

Your kernel and scheduler will need to be modified to use the timer to
implement preemptive scheduling. Because we do not require your kernel to
provide a generic timer support, it is possible to program the timer device
directly from the scheduler --- no other part of your kernel will use it.

You will also need to trigger execution of the scheduler code whenever the
timer interrupts the currently running thread. To this end, you will
need to modify the general exception handler to recognize and properly
handle the timer interrupt, and to trigger the scheduler code. See the
section on [exception handling](#exception-handling) for more details.

### Configurable quantum

Preemptive scheduler operates with the concept of a *quantum*, which
determines the maximum time a thread is allowed to run before the
scheduler unconditionally switches to another thread. A shorter
*quantum* causes threads to be switched faster (making the system more
responsive) at the cost of higher overhead due to context switching.

The value of *quantum* also influences the interleaving of threads, which
makes it useful for testing, because different values can lead to different
thread schedules and help expose race conditions.

For this reason, your scheduler should use the `KERNEL_SCHEDULER_QUANTUM`
macro, which was added to [`proc/scheduler.c`](kernel/src/proc/scheduler.c),
as the value of a thread quantum. This will make it possible to test your
code with different quanta, which is exactly what the tests provided with
this milestone do.

Real kernels are usually configured with quantum specified in milliseconds.
To ensure deterministic executions we will always define quantum based on
instruction count (i.e. you configure the timer to raise the interrupt after
kernel executes `KERNEL_SCHEDULER_QUANTUM` instructions).

---

## Part 2: Synchronization primitives (optional extensions)

There are many synchronization primitives, but the optional part of this
milestone only concerns two of them. The first is *mutex*, declared in the
[`proc/mutex.h`](kernel/include/proc/mutex.h) header file, which allows
implementing *mutual exclusion*, the most basic synchronization task.

The second is a *semaphore*, declared in the [`proc/sem.h`](kernel/include/proc/sem.h)
header file, which allows multiple threads to enter a critical section at the
same time. Semaphores are a bit more complex, and are used for synchronization
tasks involving a fixed number of resources, e.g., producer/consumer
with a bounded buffer.

Just like in previous milestones, the header files prescribe the API
that you are required to implement. Both mutexes and semaphores must
use *passive waiting*. That, however, requires managing sleeping threads.
You may want to start with simpler, active-waiting variants, which do
not require thread management.

---

## Thread safety

All kernel code that can execute under preemptive scheduling **must be made
thread-safe**. Specifically, any function (e.g., `kmalloc()` and `kfree()`)
that works with data that can be accessed concurrently from multiple threads
must synchronize access to the shared data. In addition, some interactions
between subsystems must be atomic.

This can result in a chicken-and-egg problem, because synchronization
primitives such as mutexes or semaphores rely on the thread and scheduler
subsystems, which means they cannot be used to implement, e.g., mutual
exclusion, in those subsystems. This also applies to the implementation of
the sychronization primitives themselves.

I such cases, you will need at least a rudimentary form of locking, which
can be (at least initially) implemented by temporarily disabling interrupts,
which is used in the following examples. See the section on
[low-level mutual exclusion](#low-level-mutual-exclusion) for more details.

To illustrate the required changes, consider the following code which
always updates the `pre` member of a shared data structure, but updates
the `post` member only when `update_post` is `true`:

```c
void do_something_with_shared_data(bool update_post) {
    shared_data.pre = shared_data.pre + 1;
    if (!update_post) {
        return;
    }
    shared_data.post = shared_data.post + 1;
}
```

The code works just fine in a cooperatively-scheduled system, but is not
thread-safe in a preemptively-scheduled system. We can protect the shared data
structure by disabling interrupts as follows:

```c
void do_something_with_shared_data(bool update_post) {
    bool saved = interrupts_disable();

    shared_data.pre = shared_data.pre + 1;
    if (!update_post) {
        interrupts_restore(saved);
        return;
    }
    shared_data.post = shared_data.post + 1;

    interrupts_restore(saved);
}
```

Note that the above code interleaves two responsibilities (locking and data
manipulation), which makes the code more complicated, because you need to keep
track of early returns to issue the call to `interrupts_restore()` before
returning.

To reduce code complexity in such situations (especially with pair operations
such as mutex lock/unlock or disable/enable interrupts), we recommend to keep
the two responsibilities separate by splitting the code into two functions
--- one responsible for the pair operation and the other responsible for
the actual operation on a data structure, as follows:


```c
static void unsafe_do_something_with_shared_data(bool update_post) {
    shared_data.pre = shared_data.pre + 1;
    if (!update_post) {
        return;
    }
    shared_data.post = shared_data.post + 1;
}

void do_something_with_shared_data(bool update_post) {
    bool saved = interrupts_disable();

    unsafe_do_something_with_shared_data(update_post);

    interrupts_restore(saved);
}
```

---

## Support code

Just like the previous milestones, this milestone updates the kernel
base code to provide the necessary context and some convenience
functions. We recommend to review the update to get an idea what has
changed and where.


### Low-level mutual exclusion

Without synchronization primitives such as mutexes and semaphores, mutual
exclusion can be implemented as *active waiting* by (repeatedly) checking
the value of a variable using a *test-and-set* operation in a loop. Such
an implementation is usually referred to as *spin-lock*. However, because
your kernel is only expected to run on a single processor, you can use an
even simpler approach, which relies on temporarily disabling interrupts.

Disabling interrupts means that the processor *ignores* interrupt requests,
which allows the currently executing thread to run through a (critical)
section of code without being interrupted and rescheduled (recall that
the scheduler relies on timer interrupts to switch between threads
unconditionally. After reaching the end of the critical section, interrupts
need to be enabled again to resume normal preemptive scheduling.

Control over interrupts is provided by the `interrupts_disable()` and
`interrupts_restore()` functions defined in the [`exc.h`](kernel/include/exc.h)
header file. The `bool interrupts_disable()` function returns the CPU
interrupt-processing state prior to disabling interrupts, while the
`void interrupts_restore(bool)` function restores the interrupt-processing
state to the given value. This allows using the functions in nested calls.
See the section on [interrupt control](#interrupt-control) for more details.

**Note:** disabling interrupts does not make the interrupt requests go away
--- if an interrupt request is pending, you can expect it to interrupt
the processor the moment interrupt processing on the processor is enabled.

**Note:** the interrupt-processing state is part of the thread context (similar
to CPU registers), i.e., disabling interrupts in one thread has no impact on
the interrupt-processing state in other thread. A (kernel) thread may disable
interrupts and switch to another thread in which interrupt-processing is
enabled. This is a feature, not a bug.


### Exception handling

The most important change is in exception handling. Instead of dumping CPU
registers and switching the simulator to interactive mode, the code at the
`exception_general` entry point in [`head.S`](kernel/src/head.S) now jumps
to an actual handler (`handle_exception_general_asm`) defined in
[`exc/handlers.S`](kernel/src/exc/handlers.S).

The handler saves the complete context (exception context) of the interrupted
thread on the stack and calls the `handle_exception_general()` function defined
in [`exc/exc.c`](kernel/src/exc/exc.c), which is responsible for handling general
exceptions (including interrupts).


The `handle_exception_general()` function receives a single argument of type
`exc_context_t *`, which is a pointer to *exception context* containing the
values of CPU registers at the time of exception (interrupt) along with
important control registers that need to be preserved. The exception context
is defined in the [`ext/context.h`](kernel/include/exc/context.h) header file.

The exception handler should inspect the value of the CP0 *Cause* register in
the exception context to determine the cause of the exception (with the help
of functions defined in the [`drivers/cp0.h`](kernel/include/drivers/cp0.h)
header file) and to handle it accordingly.

To implement preemptive scheduling you should only need to handle exceptions
caused by interrupts. For any other causes you should dump the CPU and
relevant control registers and switch the simulator to interactive mode to
simplify debugging (other causes include misaligned memory accesses or
similar issues that accompany various bugs).

**Note:** First-level TLB exceptions, which may be currently triggered, e.g.,
by dereferencing a `NULL` pointer, still switch the simulator to interactive
mode, but nested TLB exceptions are handled by the general exception handler,
which is why you should report any unexpected general exceptions.


### Timer control

The MIPS processor provides a simple timer which can be configured
through the *Count* and *Compare* registers of *System Coprocessor 0*.

The *Count* register acts as a timer and is incremented by the CPU at a
constant rate. The value of the *Compare* register does not change on its
own, but whenever the *Count* register equals the *Compare* register,
the processor issues an interrupt request by setting the *Interrupt
Pending 7* (IP7) bit of the CP0 *Cause* register. This causes an
interrupt as soon as the interrupt is enabled, which causes the
processor to jump into the general exception handler.

Both registers can be read and written by kernel code, even though the
*Compare* register is intended to be write-only. Writing a value to the
*Compare* register clears the timer interrupt. For more details, see
page 103/133 of the
[MIPS R4000 Microprocessor User's Manual](https://d3s.mff.cuni.cz/files/teaching/nswi200/202324/doc/mips-r4000-manual.pdf).

The [`drivers/timer.h`](kernel/include/drivers/timer.h) header file provides
very basic support for this timer. Because your scheduler should only need to
set the interval until the next timer interrupt, the provided
`timer_interrupt_after()` function does exactly that.

Specifically, the function sets the value of the CP0 *Compare* register
to the current value of the CP0 *Count* register incremented by the given
number of CPU cycles. The number of cycles determines the interval until
next timer interrupt.


### Interrupt control

Interrupts on MIPS are controlled by bit 0 and bits 15-8 of the CP0
*Status* register. Bit 0 (*Interrupt Enable*) controls CPU
interrupt-processing state for all interrupts. Bits 15-8 (*Interrupt
Mask 7*, ..., *Interrupt Mask 0*) allow masking (disabling) individual
interrupts.

When the *Interrupt Enable* bit is cleared, the CPU ignores all
interrupts. When the bit is set, the CPU reacts to interrupts that are
enabled by the individual *Interrupt Mask* bits.

The [`exc.h`](kernel/include/exc.h) header file provides two simple functions
for coarse-grained interrupt control, i.e., these functions only manipulate the
state of the *Interrupt Enable* bit of the CP0 *Status* register.


### Debugging

We have extended the tester script to also check that code that should
panic the kernel actually panics. This is needed for example in the
`mutex_destroy` test, which checks that the kernel panics when trying to
destroy a locked mutex.

As usual, some of the tests use extended `%p` specifiers to print
details about certain kernel objects. We use `%pS` for semaphores and
`%pM` for mutexes (which is why we used `%pA` for allocated memory block
in the previous milestone). These `printk()` extensions are optional
and do not affect the test outcome.


### Tests

The tests provided in this milestone can be split into two groups:
tests for the synchronization primitives and extensions to the existing
tests to check that preemptive scheduling does not break your
implementation.

The synchronization tests check different aspects of the primitives and
should be easy to understand. The extended tests (for heap and threads)
check that the scheduler is really preemptive and that the internal data
structures are not corrupted by concurrent execution.

Because preemptive scheduling provides a lot of room for race conditions
which may only manifest under a specific thread schedule, we have added
a `KERNEL_SCHEDULER_QUANTUM` macro to [`proc/scheduler.c`](kernel/src/proc/scheduler.c)
which determines the duration of the thread time quantum. Kernel tests
can use an additional parameter (`kqNUM`, see [`suites/m04-sem-fuzzy.txt`](suites/m04-sem-fuzzy.txt))
to change this quantum from [`tools/tester.py`](tools/tester.py). This
is extremely useful for flushing out race conditions that are bound to
appear.

Note that the provided fuzzy suite is meant to be run for every commit
and is relatively short. Consider creating a custom test suite with more
fine-grained steps (and for multiple tests) to properly stress-test your
solution. However, because such a test suite can run several hours,
please **DO NOT** integrate it into your CI configuration and only run
it locally.

As usual, the tests should help you check that you have not forgotten
any major part of the implementation. It is possible to pass some tests
even with a solution that does not really work.

While passing the tests is required for this milestone, your
implementation will also be checked manually, and must include working
scheduler and thread management functions to actually pass.

## Additional hints/suggestions

  * Interrupt from timer is number 7.
  * What happens when `handle_exception_general()` returns?
  * Why do we need `interrupts_restore()` (as a counterpart to
    `interrupts_disable()`) instead of `interrupts_enable()`?

---

## Submission

The **baseline solution** for this milestone must pass the baseline tests for
`M01`, `M02`, `M03` and `M04`. The commit representing the solution must be
tagged with `m04`. Submitting a **working baseline solution** within this
milestone's deadline allows you to gain bonus points towards a better grade.

Extended features are usually covered by separate test suites (see comments on
the first line of the respective suite for details). Some features cannot be
reliably tested and will be evaluated during final review.

Please, see also the notes in the main [README.md](README.md).
