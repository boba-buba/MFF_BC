/*
 * Mutex test focusing on bad synchronization inside mutex implementation.
 *
 * We repeatedly reinitialize single mutex and lock/unlock it with a busy
 * wait before all mutex operations. This should eventually trigger the timer
 * interrupt _inside_ the mutex functions.
 *
 * With incorrect implementation we have a relatively high chance of switching
 * the mutex to inconsistent state.
 *
 * The worker thread does not do any looping as with some implementations
 * the inconsistent state could get "fixed" by repeated calls (seemingly
 * empty queue that would keep thread suspended forever could get retried
 * on next calls to mutex_unlock etc.).
 *
 * Instead the loop around creates a fresh thread and mutex pair for each
 * try, incrementing the busy wait duration.
 *
 * It is recommended to run this with different scheduler quantums. Increase
 * the amount of memory available to the OS if you do not recycle thread
 * stacks or have bump-pointer heap only.
